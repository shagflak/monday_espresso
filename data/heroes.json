(Advanced Idea Mechanics) is an organization of brilliant scientists and their hirelings dedicated to the acquisition of power and the overthrow of all government by technological means. A.I.M. was organized during World War II as the scientific research division of the subversive military organization [[Hydra]]. In the late 1960’s A.I.M. seceded from Hydra because of political differences and began independent operations. A.I.M. first came to public attention when it was incorporated as an international cartel dealing with the development and marketing of new technological products. It supplied hardware and weapons to governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. Some time after this Colonel [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] exposed A.I.M. to be a subversive organization. Since then, all of A.I.M.’s activities have been covert.\n\nA.I.M. has been involved in the creation of three major instruments of deadly potential. The first is the [[Super-Adaptoid]], an android capable of duplicating any super power (Project: [[Them]]). The second instrument was the Cosmic Cube, an unimaginably powerful object capable of restructuring reality itself. A.I.M. manufactured the containing device – the cube – reality-rending energy itself.\n\nThe third major achievement of A.I.M. is the creation of [[M.O.D.O.K.]] (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), an artificially mutated human being with an enormous head and a stunted body possessing superhuman intelligence and the ability to generate mental energy bolts and forcefields. M.O.D.O.K. was originally an ordinary A.I.M. member who was selected by A.I.M.’s Scientist Supreme to be the subject of a mutation experiment. After being transformed, M.O.D.O.K. slew the Scientist Supreme and became the new leader of A.I.M., a position he has held ever since. A.I.M. has stagnated and has created no truly impressive weapon or launched any major attack on any nation.\n\nThere still exist a splinter group of A.I.M. agents who escaped being taken over by M.O.D.O.K. Unlike M.O.D.O.K.’s agents who are all clad in yellow; this renegade section of A.I.M. is clad in blue. The two factions have clashed on occasion, with M.O.D.O.K.’s group proving superior.\n\nM.O.D.O.K. was later killed by [[Anaconda]], [[Cottonmouth]] and [[Death Adder]]. Anaconda took his body back to A.I.M. for the reward they were promised.",

        "bio" : "Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into the incredible [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]]. As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk. While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.\n\nGiven his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. The Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath.\n\nIn recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married [[Ross-Banner, Betty|Betty Ross]], the daughter of [[Ross, Thaddeus|General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.\n\nNot only had his grand scheme failed, but Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhorred the most - it was he who was the rampaging, inhuman monster; not the Hulk as he had religiously believed all these years.\n\nMonths later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulated the Hulk into attacking and almost killing Blonsky. The Abomination was taken into custody by the military; as punishment, he was forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost.\n\nRecently, the Abomination was among the first victims murdered at the hands of the [[Red Hulk]].",

She had unknowingly used her power to phase through solid matter for the first time, passing through her bed and floor into the room below.\n\n[[image:KittyPryde-Ariel.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Kitty as Ariel]]After Frost left, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] arrived with three of the [[X-Men]], his own team of mutant students who fought for peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Following an attack by the Hellfire Club during which Kitty helped the team, the X-Man [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Phoenix]] telepathically coerced Kitty's parents into allowing her to join Xavier's school, and she became the newest and youngest member of the X-Men. Kitty originally called herself Sprite, but later adopted the codename Ariel. Xavier also arranged for Kitty to be enrolled in dance classes at the studio of instructor [[Hunter, Stevie|Stevie Hunter]].\n\nKitty quickly became a valuable member of the X-Men, proving her worth one Christmas Eve by single-handedly defeating one of the demonic [[N'Garai]]. Kitty formed a close friendship with both the X-Man [[Storm]] and the mutant sorceress [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]]. The bond between Kitty and Illyana grew so strong that Kitty was eventually able to manifest the Soulsword, the ultimate expression of Illyana's magical nature.\n\n\nKitty also formed a romance with her teammate Piotr Rasputin ([[Colossus (Piotr Rasputin)|Colossus]]), and she gained a constant companion on an adventure in space in the form of a small alien dragon-like creature she named [[Lockheed]]. Kitty gained another close friend when she met [[Cypher (Douglas Ramsey)|Doug Ramsey]], a fellow student in Stevie Hunter's dance class with whom she shared an affinity for computers. Doug's death on a mission with the [[New Mutants]] would prove to be the first of many personal losses Kitty would suffer.\n\n\n[[image: kittypyrde03.jpg|left|150px|thumb]]After a visit to her recently divorced father, Carmen, Kitty learned that he had become involved with the Japanese Yakuza and followed him to Japan where she was captured and put under the mental control of Ogun, the martial arts master who had once been her teammate Wolverine's teacher. Using Kitty's body, Ogun attempted to kill Wolverine but failed. Wolverine then taught Kitty to become skilful enough in the martial arts to combat Ogun, and together they managed to exorcise Ogun's spirit. During the course of this adventure, Kitty took to calling herself Shadowcat.\n\nWhile Colossus was away on [[Battleworld]] during what was to be called the [[Secret Wars]], he became infatuated with an alien healer named [[Zsaji]]. Upon returning to Earth, he admitted his disloyalty to Kitty, severing their romance.\n\nDuring the massacre of the underground community of mutants known as the [[Morlocks]] by the team of superhuman mutant assassins the [[Marauders (mutants)|Marauders]], Kitty was injured by an energy spear hurled by the Marauder called [[Harpoon]] that adversely affected her powers. Unable to regain her solidity, Kitty was saved by the combined efforts of the European dictator [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]] and his arch-rival, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the team of superhuman adventurers known as the [[Fantastic Four]]. However, she could now only maintain a solid form through concentration.\n\n[[image: kittypyrde02.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]After witnessing the apparent death of the X-Men, Kitty helped form the British-based super-team [[Excalibur]]. During an [[Glossary:I#interdimensional|inter-dimensional]] adventure, Kitty became separated from her teammates and, returning to her own [[Earth]], she decided to give up the life of a costumed adventurer and attend college. However, unaccustomed as she was to the British educational system, Kitty was forced to enroll in St. Searle’s School for Girls. After helping save the school from closure, Kitty rejoined her recently returned teammates.\n\nMonths later, Kitty learned that Illyana was dying from the deadly mutant-killing [[Glossary:L#Legacy_Virus|Legacy Virus]], a disease that targeted mutants. Kitty was present when Illyana finally succumbed to the disease, unaware that the young mutant's death bonded the Soulsword to her. Eventually the arcane magic's of the sword began to corrupt Kitty, and she surrendered the weapon to her then teammate [[Magik (Amanda Sefton)|Daytripper]] who in turn gave it to her mother, the gypsy sorceress [[Szardos, Margali|Margali Szardos]].\n\nSoon after, Excalibur was approached by the clandestine organization known as [[Black Air]] for assistance on a mission to the island nation of [[Genosha]]. They were assigned a liaison in [[Wisdom, Peter|Pete Wisdom]], an uncouth British mutant who regularly clashed with the outspoken Kitty. The pair eventually overcame their initial impressions of one another and fell in love. Wisdom even resigned from Black Air and joined Excalibur to be with Kitty.\n\nLater, Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters. Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun’s spirit having infiltrated the computer system, and with the aid of Wolverine, she managed to purge Ogun's presence. During this time, Kitty was attracted to a S.H.I.E.L.D. intern her own age, and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom. Soon after, she broke off their relationship.\n\nKitty remained a member of Excalibur until it disbanded whereupon she rejoined the X-Men. Soon after, an incident in Genosha caused Kitty to develop a rebellious attitude, reflected by her cutting her hair short, her more ferocious combat technique, and her taking to wielding one of Wolverine's broken bone claws in battle.\n\nWhen Colossus sacrificed his life to release a cure for the Legacy Virus, his body was supposedly cremated, and Kitty scattered the ashes over his Russian farmland home. Mourning the loss of her old friend, and trying to live a normal life, Kitty left the X-men. She enrolled in the Robert A. Heinlein School for Engineering and Astrophysics in Chicago on a full scholarship, yet chose to live off campus and began working as a bartender for her neighbor at his establishment, the Belles of Hell. Kitty found herself unable to escape the ever-prevalent prejudice of humans, and she soon clashed with members of a student anti-mutant organization named Purity. Kitty was put on probation and was forced to attend mandatory counseling. During this time, Kitty faced her most difficult loss when she learned her father was amongst those killed in an attack on Genosha.\n\nKitty's battle against Purity continued after the organization attempted to frame her for the sabotage of a research experiment. A student meeting was called to debate the banning of either Purity or mutants from campus, but discussions were cut short by an attack by a new breed of mutant-hunting robotic [[Sentinels]] which were destroyed by Kitty with the help of former New Mutant [[Karma]] and Genoshan exchange student [[Inkosi, Shola|Shola Inkosi]].\n\n[[image: kittypyrde01.jpg|right|200px|thumb]]Kitty was later abducted by the mutant-hating [[Stryker, William|Reverend Stryker]] to help expose the technological threat of the mutant retreat known as Mount Haven and its mysterious leader, Reverend Paul. Together, Stryker and Kitty discovered that Paul was an artificial intelligence who had killed the human townspeople and used microbial machines called nanites to transform the minds of the mutant residents from organic matter into cybernetic computers linked to his central consciousness. When Storm's team of X-Men arrived to find Kitty, Paul sought to transform them as well. Stryker attempted to use Kitty's power to disrupt electronics to destroy Paul, but he failed and Paul responded by transferring his consciousness into a global network. In an effort to safeguard his kind from Paul’s threat, Stryker merged with him in an attempt to teach him about humanity, and the town of Haven was buried by a volcanic eruption.\n\nSoon after, Kitty assisted Storm’s team against the threat of mutant predator [[Bogan, Elias|Elias Bogan]]. After Bogan was defeated, Kitty accompanied the team back to the mansion and was asked to remain as a member of [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops’]] restructured X-Men. Peter Rasputin was discovered to be alive, his body secretly been stolen and resuscitated by [[Ord]], an alien who had learned that an Earth mutant would be responsible for destroying his world. Kitty found Peter shortly before the X-Men's final battle with Ord, after which he rejoined the X-Men. After many years apart, Kitty and Peter reignited their romance.",

Because her father had been a member, she was sent to infiltrate the [[Hellfire Club]], but was warned off by [[Sage|Tessa]] for her own protection.\n\n\nWhen the crimelord [[Vixen (crimelord)|Vixen]] secretly usurped S.T.R.I.K.E., she hired [[Slaymaster]] to eliminate the Psi-Division before they could expose this. The telepaths fled, but Slaymaster continued to pick them off; only a handful were left when Betsy sensed Brian's return and called on his help. He defeated Slaymaster and the three surviving psi's (Betsy, Tom and Alison Double) moved into the holographically hidden Braddock Manor. In short succession this hideout was found by the Special Executive, Captain U.K. and the [[Fury]]; as the last of these battled Brian and the Executive, Betsy foresaw a future where superhumans were imprisoned in concentration camps. Soon the U.K. became a fascist state ruled by the insane reality warper [[Mad Jim Jaspers (Earth-616)|Sir James Jaspers]], with S.T.R.I.K.E. \"Beetle\" squads rounding up those with powers. While Brian confronted Jaspers, the Beetles found the others' hideout. Tom died trying to buy his friends time to escape; Betsy was in Tom's mind when he died, and was captured. After being freed, she was nursed back to health by fellow camp inmate Victoria Bentley, who taught her to use her experiences to strengthen her powers. When [[Kaptain Briton]], Brian's Earth-794 counterpart, tried to rape her, Betsy fried his mind, killing him. The same night, Mastermind informed the twins of their father's non-terrestrial origins, and the Resources Control Executive (R.C.X.) asked them to billet Warpies, children transformed by Jaspers' warp, at the Manor. One of the R.C.X. agents was Matthew, now codenamed Gabriel. Betsy overruled Brian and let R.C.X. and the Warpies move in. When Brian went overseas, Gabriel convinced Betsy to become the new Captain Britain, wearing Kaptain Briton's modified costume. Working with Captain U.K. (Linda McQuillan), the duo became public sensations, but after several months Betsy went solo. Vixen lured her into a showdown with Slaymaster, who brutally beat her, then gouged her eyes out. Brian felt her pain, flew to her rescue and killed Slaymaster. Betsy refused R.C.X.'s offer of cybernetic eyes, preferring to rely on her psychic abilities; she and Gabriel got engaged, and went to Switzerland for Betsy to recuperate. \n\nBetsy was kidnapped from the Alps by Mojo, brainwashed, given cybernetic eyes, and, as \"Psylocke,\" became the star of his new show \"Wildways.\" Brian and the [[New Mutants]] rescued her, after which Betsy moved to the X-Men's mansion to recover, exactly where [[Roma]] (Merlyn's daughter) needed her to be. When the [[Marauders (mutants)|Marauders]] attacked the [[Morlocks]], and [[Sabretooth]] invaded the mansion, she used herself as bait to lead him away from the injured until [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] got there. Impressed by her bravery, Wolverine nominated her to join the [[X-Men]], beside whom she met [[Mephisto]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Horde]]. The X-Men later battled [[Freedom Force]] and the [[Adversary]] in Dallas, and, in a televised battle, sacrificed themselves to allow [[Forge]] to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the [[Siege Perilous]], which they could use if they ever wanted to start new lives. The X-Men moved to the [[Reavers]]' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood Boys, [[Genosha|Genoshan]] Magistrates, M Squad, Mr. Jip, the [[Serpent Society]], the [[Abomination]], [[Master Mold]], [[Nimrod]], [[Nanny (cyborg)|Nanny]], the [[Orphan-Maker]], [[Zaladane]] and the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. As they were about to depart the [[Savage Land]], Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.\n\n\nBetsy reappeared amnesiac on an island near China, where the [[Hand]] found her. [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], their leader, saw a chance to save his brain-dead lover, [[Kwannon]], and had [[Spiral (Rita Wayword)|Spiral]]'s [[Body Shoppe]] swap their souls. This inadvertently blended their minds, leaving each with the same memories and telepathic powers. Tsurayaba brainwashed Psylocke and gave her to the [[Mandarin]] as his assassin, Lady Mandarin, until Wolverine restored her memories. Back with the X-Men Betsy took on [[Hodge, Cameron|Cameron Hodge]], [[Warskrulls]], the [[Shadow King]] and [[Glossary:C#cosmic|cosmic]] cleaner [[Edifice Rex]]; she also informed Brian she was alive. The next few months saw battles against [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], [[Fenris]], [[Mys-Tech]] (alongside new ally [[Dark Angel (Shevaun Haldane)|Dark Angel]]), and a [[Brood]]-infected [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. Visiting Brian, Betsy helped Excalibur fight Sat-Yr-9 and the now insane Jamie, whom Betsy struck comatose. Encounters followed with the [[Troll Associates]], the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], [[Stryfe]], [[Omega Red]], and the [[Soul Skinner]].\n\nThen Kwannon arrived at the Mansion in Betsy's original body, claiming to be the real Psylocke. Unable to discern which was truly Betsy, both stayed with the X-Men, maintaining an uneasy coexistence, with Kwannon taking the name Revanche. Learning she had the [[Glossary:L#Legacy Virus|Legacy Virus]], Revanche had Matsu'o kill her, after which Betsy regained her soul's missing piece. Having become involved with her teammate [[Archangel|Angel]], the following months saw her fight the [[Phalanx]], try to reach Jamie's comatose mind, battle [[Legion (David Haller)|Legion]] in Israel, and combat [[Gene Nation]]. When Sabretooth gutted Psylocke, Angel, Wolverine, [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]] and [[Gomurr]] the Ancient retrieved a [[Glossary:M#magic|magical]] liquid from the Crimson Dawn dimension which healed her and gave her new powers, but also marked her with a red tattoo over her left eye. [[Kuragari]], Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, tried to claim Betsy as his bride, but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel's aid, freeing Betsy of the Dawn's influence. Subsequently she aided [[Storm]] against the Shadow King, who tricked Psylocke into initiating a psychic shockwave which disabled all other telepaths, leaving him unchallenged on the [[Glossary:A#astral plane|astral plane]]. Her own astral form was destroyed, but her exposure to the Crimson Dawn gave her a new shadow form with temporarily enhanced powers, which she used to trap the Shadow King's core. To keep him trapped she was forced to constantly focus her telepathy on him, effectively rendering herself powerless. After attending Brian's wedding, she was kidnapped to take part in the Coterie's contest of champions. When [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]] and his Horsemen sought to gather the Twelve, Psylocke used [[Cerebro]] to boost her powers, so that she could use them and still keep the Shadow King imprisoned, allowing her to free the brainwashed Wolverine. Jean Grey's attempt to help Betsy deal with the Shadow King somehow swapped their powers, leaving Betsy telekinetic. With her new abilities Betsy fought [[Belasco]], the Neo, the Goth, and the [[Prime Sentinels]], then aided her brother freeing [[Otherworld]] from Mastermind's Warpie army.\n\n\nAfter ending her relationship with Archangel, Betsy joined Storm's X-Men team in the search for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s Diaries. In Valencia, Spain, they encountered the enigmatic [[Vargas]] who killed her. Later, in a dream, Bishop saw Betsy's spirit being snatched by a skulled figure. Much later, Betsy was returned alive to the site of her death. Reunited with the X-Men, she helped them against the Saurian Hauk'ka, Mojo and Spiral. She has also been reunited with Brian during a recent reality storm. It is now known that her brother, Jamie, had brought her back to life to fight a great evil and had reconstructed her to be immune to attacks meant to control her mind, reshape her body, or affect her basic quantum structure. Recently, she has joined the dimension hopping group, the Exiles.",

Magno locks within his body could release his limbs at will or disassemble nearby machinery, incorporating their parts into his limbs or the War Machine armor.

        "bio" : "Iron Man’s closest ally is Jim “Rhodey” Rhodes, a stalwart force of justice. A soldier in steel and circuitry – he is the indomitable War Machine!\n\n==ORIGIN OF A HERO==\n[[image:MikeFichera--Glenda-Parnell-Rhodey-wedding.jpg|thumb|left|Glenda, Parnell, and Rhodey]]James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes was a US Marine who served several tours in Southeast Asia while studying to become an aviation engineer. In the service, he grew close with his comrade Parnell Jacobs, whom he introduced to childhood friend Glenda Sandoval. Parnell and Glenda eventually fell in love and married. \n\nRhodes was a soldier with a conscience, willing to kill if a mission required it, yet haunted by every life he took. During one mission, Rhodes’ helicopter was shot down in a jungle and was discovered by Iron Man (Tony Stark), who had recently escaped from the guerrilla Wong-Chu and needed transportation. Iron Man helped repair Rhodes’ helicopter and they made it to safety together. Afterward, Rhodes was approached by Tony Stark, claiming to be Iron Man’s \"employer,\" and was offered a job as Stark’s pilot. Rhodes agreed to take him up on his offer when his tour of duty was completed. For a while, Rhodes worked as a mercenary with Parnell, but when he caught Parnell running guns to the dictatorship of Santo Marco, he went back to Tony to make good on his word. \n\n==THE NEW IRON MAN==\n[[image:MikeFichera--Rhodey-as-IronMan.jpg |left|thumb|Rhodey as Iron Man]]\nRhodes served for some time at Stark International as Stark’s pilot and became Tony’s close friend, risking his life to aid Tony against enemies such as [[Hammer, Justin|Justin Hammer]] and the [[Maggia]]. He watched helplessly as Stark gradually gave in to alcoholism. After a humiliating defeat battling the villain Magma (Jonathan Darque) while intoxicated, Iron Man went to Rhodes for help recharging his armor and inadvertently revealed his identity. Too inebriated to continue his fight with Magma, Stark passed out and Rhodes donned the armor becoming Iron Man for the first time. He saved Stark International from Magma’s rampage and Stark asked him to continue as Iron Man.\n\nAlthough a novice, Rhodes’ combat experience served him well for his new role as a super hero. Meanwhile, Stark continued to drink and eventually lost Stark International to his rival [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]. Rhodes made sure Tony’s alternate Iron Man armors were destroyed to prevent them from falling into Stane’s hands and carried on Iron Man’s tradition. \n\n==SECRET WARS AND POWERFUL ALLIES==\nAs Iron Man, Jim faced threats from foes like [[Thunderball]], the [[Radioactive Man (Chen Lu)|Radioactive Man]], and the [[Mandarin]]. Together with many of Earth’s heroes, he fought against an army of some of the toughest super villains on the constructed planet called Battleworld during the near-omnipotent [[Beyonder|Beyonder's]] so-called “[[Secret Wars]].” Most of these heroes continued to believe he was the original Iron Man. Soon after his return from [[Battleworld]], Rhodes learned that Stark was trying to make a recovery and gradually allowed him back into his life. Rhodes, Stark and inventor siblings Morley and Clytemnestra Erwin set up their own company, [[Circuits Maximus]].\n\nThough his teammates assumed he was the same Iron Man who helped found the [[Avengers]], Rhodes joined the [[West Coast Avengers|West Coast branch]] of the Avengers in Los Angeles under the leadership of [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. Hawkeye was shocked when he learned that he was not working with the original armored hero.\n\nRhodes’ time as Iron Man ended when Obadiah Stane blew up Circuits Maximus, killing Morley and injuring Rhodes. He offered his Iron Man armor back to Tony so he could bring down Stane, but Stark built a new suit of armor instead and faced Stane in a battle that ended with Stane’s suicide. Stark remained active as Iron Man, and Rhodes resumed his role as his pilot and confidant at the new company Stark Enterprises. However, Rhodes became Iron Man again to aid the Avengers against the renegade mutant [[Quicksilver]], the Zodiac Life Model Decoys (LMDs) and to help Tony against the Living Laser. While re-entering Earth’s atmosphere from an excursion to Stark Satellite One, Rhodes was badly burned through the armor and thereafter seldom wore it. During this time, he was romantically involved with Stark’s public relations director Marcy Pearson. Tony began to suffer from nervous system troubles during his clashes with Kearson DeWitt, causing Rhodes to become Iron Man again to help fight DeWitt and later the Mandarin and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. \n\n==I AM WAR MACHINE==\n[[image:WAR_MACHINE_5.jpg|left|thumb|200px|War Machine]]Before Tony suffered from a total nervous system collapse, he transferred control of Stark Enterprises to Rhodes and left him his most recent Iron Man suit (nicknamed the \"War Machine\" armor). Rhodes reluctantly honored his best friend’s dying wish and became Iron Man again. His first action as CEO of Stark Enterprises was to fire his girlfriend Marcy Pearson, whose ruthless career goals had soured their relationship. Subsequently, he became involved with Rae LaCoste, a former girlfriend of Tony’s. Believing Tony Stark to be dead, Rhodes was insulted when he learned that Tony had faked his death so his scientists could find a cure for his condition while sustained in a cryogenic state. Tony let Rhodey keep the War Machine armor as a peace offering, but Rhodes wanted nothing else to do with him. As War Machine, he rejoined the West Coast Avengers, but resigned after an angry confrontation with Iron Man during a team meeting preceding the closing of the West Coast Avengers branch.\n\n==JIM RHODES: DIRECTOR OF WORLDWATCH==\nRhodey accepted the role of director of [[Worldwatch]], a human rights organization, where he gained valuable allies including former Mossad/[[S.H.I.E.L.D]]. agent Bathsheva Joseph. During this time, Tony and Rhodey finally came to terms in the course of a team-up against the Mandarin. War Machine and Bathsheva time traveled to World War II to stop Grinz, a Nazi officer who was receiving advanced technology from his son Raeder from modern times. Rhodes killed Grinz to prevent Raeder from being born and the resulting paradox shunted Rhodes and Bathsheva back to their own time. The War Machine armor was seemingly destroyed in transit. \n\nBonded to a suit of ancient alien Eidolon Warwear armor, Rhodey was forced to battle a mind-controlled Tony Stark, who had become a sleeper agent of [[Immortus]]. Stark gave his life opposing Immortus. S.H.I.E.L.D. sought to study the Warwear and attempted to capture Rhodes, but he resisted them and resigned from Worldwatch to preserve the organization’s good name.\n\n==SEPARATIONS, BANKRUPTCY AND MURDER==\nWith Tony gone, Stark Enterprises became [[Stark-Fujikawa]]. Rhodey was offered a position with them, but upon learning that they were after the secrets of the Iron Man armor, he sacrificed his Warwear in order to purge Tony’s computers of all data on the armor. No longer able to continue as War Machine, he began performing marine salvage with his own company, Rhodes Recovery. Soon after, Tony returned to life thanks to [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards’]] reality-altering powers. Rhodes Recovery eventually went bankrupt as a consequence of Jim’s extravagant lifestyle and an unscrupulous accountant. \n\nAt that time, Jim’s sister Jeanette was killed by members of the 66 Bridges gang. Unable to get at her killers through the police, Rhodes became a vigilante to bring the 66 Bridges to justice. Rhodes used part of a prototype War Machine armor to face off with Triage, the head of this gang, and they were dispersed by Rhodes and his allies.\n\n==MUTANT MANAGEMENT==\nWhen the Office of National Emergency (O*N*E) began to train human pilots in the use of giant mutant hunting robotic [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinels]], Tony arranged for Rhodes to be assigned as their drill sergeant. He donned a new suit of armor based on the Iron Man designs in order to lead O*N*E and also piloted his own Sentinel nicknamed “War Machine.” He led a team of O*N*E pilots against the Savage Land Mutates and aided the X-Men against their foe [[Apocalypse]] (En Sabah Nur). When the superhuman community was plunged into a civil war over disagreement on the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA), of which Tony was a major proponent, Rhodes piloted the War Machine Sentinel in an attempt to arrest the [[Black Panther (T’Challa)]] and [[Storm]] (Ororo Munroe) for violating the SHRA. However, his Sentinel was badly damaged. The Black Panther saved Rhodes from angry protesters and the latter encouraged Iron Man to let the Panther and Storm depart in peace.\n\n==WE CAN REBUILD HIM==\n[[image:MikeFichera--Rhodey-Cyborg.jpg  |left|thumb|as a cyborg]]While testing fighter jets in Dubai, Rhodes was attacked by terrorists and suffered horrific injuries costing him all four limbs and most of the right side of his face. Tony intervened and used bleeding edge technology to build him cybernetic replacements. Rhodes’ ex-girlfriend Bethany Cabe prepared a genetic clone of Jim’s body with the ultimate goal of transferring his consciousness into it. Requiring an external power source to stay alive, Rhodey once again became War Machine and seldom removed the armor, finding that he was incapable of sleep due to his cybernetic link. The armor Tony provided Rhodes was constructed of mostly non-Stark parts as a failsafe in case Tony’s systems were infiltrated. \n\nWar Machine was made the field commander to oversee Camp Hammond, in Stamford, Connecticut, where the 50-state Initiative enacted by the SHRA began to prepare registered superhuman cadets for their licensed activities. When the Skrulls, led by Queen Veranke, attacked Earth, disabling Stark’s technology, Rhodes received a coded message from Tony directing him to a stealth satellite in Earth’s orbit specially designed to equip his armor and combat the Skrull threat.\n\nWhen the invasion was over, [[Osborn, Norman|Norman Osborn]] (the pardoned Green Goblin) had become leader of the Initiative and H.A.M.M.E.R. (replacing S.H.I.E.L.D.) and obtained his own Iron Man armor as the Iron Patriot. Though he was under Osborn’s command, Rhodes attempted to covertly aid Tony, now a wanted fugitive, in escaping Osborn. War Machine protected the world from the threat of the infectious robotic extraterrestrial Ultimo virus, and earned the adulation of the Olympian god, Ares. \n\n==A NEW BEGINNING==\nOsborn raided the facility where Rhodes’ clone body was kept to use as blackmail against Rhodey. Undaunted, Rhodes went rogue along with five allies calling themselves “Team War Machine” who helped destroy the remaining Ultimo parts. The Iron Patriot assisted Rhodes against Ultimo, but then captured Rhodes and sent him to the International Criminal Court. After Ares broke him out of custody, Rhodey sacrificed his life to save a child from an attack by Osborn. However, at the moment of Rhodes’ death, Suzi Endo (aka Cybermancer) transferred Jim’s consciousness into the waiting clone body. No longer a cyborg, Rhodey donned a new suit of War Machine armor to continue his adventures.",

        "bio" : "Franklin Richards is the elder child of Earth’s first family of super heroes. He had a troubled childhood from the start; while pregnant with him, [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] suffered strange “cosmic impulses of living energy” in her blood due to the cosmic rays that empowered the [[Fantastic Four]], risking the lives of herself and her unborn son. The rest of the Fantastic Four entered the [[Negative Zone]] and retrieved [[Annihilus]]’ Cosmic Control Rod, which [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] used to reduce the energy’s effects. Though the birth proved uneventful, Franklin would become one of Earth’s most powerful mutants. Reed and Sue named their child after Susan’s father Franklin, who sacrificed his own life to save his children, and after Reed’s best friend, [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Benjamin Grimm]]. \n\n[[image: franklin01.jpg|thumb|left|300px]]Franklin’s powers manifested when he was still young: he perceived his invisible mother, controlled ants’ behaviors, and restored consciousness to his “uncle” Ben. Realizing something unusual was occurring, Reed studied Franklin to try and understand and control the infant’s powers; but Annihilus came to similar conclusions and kidnapped Franklin to the Negative Zone, where he enhanced Franklin’s energy with a cosmic ray gene trasmuter. Though the Fantastic Four defeated Annihilus, Franklin’s powers continued to accelerate, threatening to release psychic energy “strong enough to kill every living creature in the solar system”. With no time to act and with no options, Reed used an experimental and defective anti-matter weapon which stopped the power build-up but left Franklin comatose. Many months later, a psychic assault by [[Ultron|Ultron-7]] against the [[Avengers]], [[Inhumans]], and Fantastic Four inadvertently restored Franklin; his unconscious mind retaliated against Ultron and Franklin awoke with his powers dormant. \n\nHis powers quiescent for years, Franklin enjoyed a more normal childhood. A resilient child, the powerless Franklin adapted to his parents’ chaotic lives, once holding off the mercenary [[Deadpool]] with his own gun; however his powers reemerged when Franklin’s nanny [[Harkness, Agatha|Agatha Harkness]] and the Fantastic Four were taken captive by Nicholas Scratch and Salem’s Seven. Franklin’s unconscious mind was strong enough to free Agatha, the entire population of New Salem, and his family from Scratch’s control. Scratch possessed Franklin, using his powers against the Fantastic Four, but the team freed him with Agatha’s help. Developing conscious control over his powers, Franklin wielded them against the alien Brain Parasites which controlled his mother. Reed resumed testing Franklin’s powers until one test resulted in Franklin’s unconscious mind creating Ego-Spawn, a superhuman manifestation of Franklin’s insecurities. Reed took more covert actions after that, creating HUBERT (Hyper-Ultronic Brain Employing Randomized Tracings), a robotic baby-sitter for Franklin which monitored him for superhuman activity. Franklin soon lost control of his powers, transforming into an amnesiac, virtually omnipotent adult dubbed Avatar. When his mother realized who he truly was, Franklin restored himself to childhood, placing psychic dampers in his own brain to limit his own access to his powers. Simultaneously, he restored Ben to his rocky Thing state he’d temporarily lost. (The realization that Ben subconsciously wanted to be the Thing stopped Franklin from actually curing him). Losing his powers again gave Franklin as normal a childhood as possible in a life where he could be whisked off across galaxies without notice, as happened when Franklin and the Thing saved the K’rithian race from an alien Gh’runji Gobbler, or where his bedroom could be unexpectedly invaded by miniature Micronauts. \n\n[[image: franklin02.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]Franklin’s mother became pregnant again, but the pregnancy was cut short with a stillbirth. Though no one realized it, Franklin’s future self would unconsciously intervene to save the dying child, sending it “somewhere else”. The family moved to Belle Porte, Connecticut, where Franklin attended school as Franklin Benjamin. A nosy neighbor believed the family to be witches, and a subsequent exorcism led to the destruction of their home and put them at the mercy of the demon [[Mephisto]]. Franklin’s nascent powers surfaced again and he temporarily destroyed Mephisto, scattering the demon across multiple dimensions, though Mephisto would soon return and use Franklin as a plot against the [[Asgard|Asgardian]] death-goddess [[Hela]]. After the destruction of the [[Baxter Building]] at the hands of [[Doctor Doom (Kristoff Vernard)|Kristoff Vernard]], Franklin and the Four stayed at [[Avengers Mansion]] during the construction of the FF’s new headquarters. [[Jarvis, Edwin|Edwin Jarvis]], the Avengers’ butler, functioned as a caretaker for Franklin. \n\nDuring this period, Franklin’s powers again emerged, in a more controlled form: Franklin began precognitive dreaming, and could form a non-physical dream-self which could see, hear, and speak in the real world. One of his earlier dreams was of the young super-hero family known as [[Power Pack]] being attacked by aliens. While out with Jarvis, he met the Power Pack children and warned them, leading them to their Kymellian ally Kofi. The six were attacked by the Snark Jakal, an enemy of Power Pack, and it was Franklin who created the strategy to defeat him. Power Pack gave Franklin friends nearer his own age, and he enjoyed visiting a “real family” where he could watch movies, eat popcorn, and actually fight as he “never got to argue before”. The newly confident Franklin decided that he now wanted to be called “Frank”, and Katie Power gave him a super-hero name: Tattletale. With the FF off in space again, Frank spent Thanksgiving with the Power children, [[Cloak]] and [[Dagger]], [[Beta Ray Bill]], and the X-Men’s [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] and [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], also meeting future friend [[Leech]] (and Leech’s guardian [[Annalee]]) there. Tattkletale’s powers soon helped Power Pack save Leech and [[Caliban]]’s lives during the “[[Mutant Massacre]]”. \n\nWhen the Snark again attacked Power Pack, Frank pursued them in the Pack’s Smartship Friday. Tattletale’s dream-self enabled Friday to rescue Kofi, after which the trio rescued Power Pack and saved the Snark emperor from Jakal and his mother Maraud. The Fantastic Four headed for the Snark’s world to find their missing son. In the FF’s absence, Power Pack and Tattletale returned home and stayed with the Power family, while Kofi located the FF and explained that Frank had been returned. Frank and his parents were reunited in the Power’s living room, which helped forge a friendship between the two families, enabling Frank to spend more time with his friends. Frank was attacked during this period by the rogue Sentinel Master Mold, which believed that Franklin was “the Twelfth” (“Ultiman”), one of twelve mutants instrumental in humanity’s future. This information was later claimed to be false by the mutant [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]], but in any case Tattletale and Power Pack temporarily destroyed Master Mold. Unfortunately for Frank (now calling himself Franklin again), the Richardses left the Fantastic Four and moved to Stamford, Connecticut in an attempt to provide a safe life. While leaving, they were attacked by [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]], who kidnapped Franklin to use his powers to free Doom’s dead mother’s soul from Mephisto. Doom won Franklin’s trust but betrayed him to Mephisto, who jumped at the chance for vengeance. Reed followed Franklin into Hell and released Franklin’s psychic dampers, forcing Mephisto to return them both. Franklin nearly condemned Doom to Mephisto’s realm in retaliation before Reed stopped him. \n\nFranklin joined the Powers on a three-week Maine vacation, there bonding telepathically with a school of dolphins, and then left the planet with the Power children to visit New Kymellia (where the Pack fought and defeated the Kymellian warriors Force Four). The Pack met the cosmic being Numinus, who helped save the Kymellians when their artificial world was destroyed by the Snark Maraud. After the Richards family moved back to New York City, they allowed Franklin to stay with the Powers, and he attended public school beside them, again as Franklin Benjamin. When the world was threatened by the Star Stalker and a possessed [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] (Frankie Raye), Power Pack helped Franklin seek [[Galactus]] and retrieve an Elemental Obliterator. Aware that employing the device would kill him, Franklin still attempted to use it against the entity possessing Nova, but a member of the Elan race intervened. Tattletale’s time with Power Pack ended when the Powers went into space seeking help for their son Alex; though they did return, the Powers moved to Washington state, ending Franklin’s association with them. \n\nIn an alternate “Days of Future Past” reality (Earth-811), a maturing Franklin attended Xavier’s Academy, joined the New Mutants, and romanced Rachel Summers before being slain by Sentinels. As this future Franklin died, he sent a dream-self back in time to [[Marvel Universe|Earth-616]] (mainstream Earth), tapping he younger Franklin’ powers and altering reality. When this “tapping” began to harm young Franklin, the dream-self voluntarily discorporated, agan unlocking Franklin’s potential. Franklin’s grandfather [[Richards, Nathaniel|Nathaniel Richards]] returned as Franklin’s powers began manifesting anew. Claiming Franklin’s presence was a threat to the timeline, Nathaniel stole Franklin away to the future, where he trained in the other-dimensional world of Elsewhen for years beside his aunt Huntara under the Warlord Kargul. Nathaniel returned Franklin to a point in time moments after he was taken, as the now-adult Psi-Lord. \n\nAs Psi-Lord, Franklin aided his family against several threats and was briefly possessed by the malevolent psychic entity Malice before using Malice to destroy the other-dimensional Dark Raider. When his father was apparently killed and the Fantastic Four briefly dissolved, Franklin formed his own team, the [[Fantastic Force]]. Consisting of Psi-Lord, [[Huntara]], [[Vibraxas]], and [[Devlor]], the team also briefly included [[Lyja]], [[She-Hulk]], and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]]. They opposed a number of threats, including [[Klaw]], [[Dreadface]], [[Go-Devil]], and [[Diablo]]. During this time, Franklin’s powers changed again and he briefly projected three dream-selves (Avatar, Ego-Spawn, and Tattletale), while still maintaining his Psi-Lord abilities; the three dissipated when Psi-Lord released his full-force powers against Vaanguard. Fantastic Force disbanded soon after the discovery of the living Reed Richards. \n\n[[Hyperstorm]] (the child of Franklin and Rachel Summers in another divergent future, Earth-967) destroyed Psi-Lord to ensure his own existence, time traveling back and transporting the child Franklin from the moment when Nathaniel Richards kidnapped him to the present day. Psi-Lord no longer existed, and the child Franklin was restored. While the Four fought Hyperstorm, Franklin faced the evil psychic entity [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]], who disguised himself as a young child named Charlie, befriended Franklin, and absorbed Franklin Richards and the powerful mutant [[X-Man]] (Nate Grey) into himself. While X-Man and Franklin escaped from within, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and several others sacrificed their lives to stop Onslaught. Franklin emerged alive to find his family seemingly dead. In the aftermath, Franklin was given into his grandfather’s custody. \n\nAfter a ceremony honouring the fallen (where he gifted [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] to the [[Thunderbolts]], who later destroyed it), Franklin attended Emma Frost’s Massachusetts Academy branch of Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters. He studied with children his own age, including Artie Maddicks and his old acquaintance Leech. When the Academy was attacked, Franklin unconsciously rescued himself by creating a dimensional gate. This act transported the [[Man-Thing]] there, and Franklin, along with Man-Thing, Leech, Artie, Tana Nile (an alien Rigellian who’d been recuperating there) and [[Howard the Duck]], became lost in a succession of child-like memories, chased by the shadowy being known as the Dark Hunter. It became apparent over the course of their travels that Franklin’s powers were creating friendlier realities for them, including a reality giving the Man-Thing the power of speech. The Dark Hunter was revealed to be a manifestation of the pain and fear Franklin couldn’t accept, and Franklin ultimately merged with the Dark Hunter, accepting the loss of his parents. \n\n[[image: franklin03.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]Franklin was soon approached by the Celestial Ashema, who showed Franklin that his parents (and Earth’s other heroes) were alive. Franklin had subconsciously shunted them into a new reality, another Earth which resided in the blue globe Franklin had been carrying with him since Onslaught. Ashema forced Franklin to make a choice: one of the worlds had to die. Literally fleeing from this awful choice, Franklin plummeted over a cliff, nearly dying. To ressurect him, Ashema melded with Franklin’s consciouness, acquiring his human perspective on life and death. Through Franklin, a compromise was struck: both worlds could live, but Earth’s heroes had to leave Franklin’s creation and return to their own world. Franklin’s alternate Earth was later transported to our solar system by Dr. Doom and placed in orbit on the far side of the sun, where it was named Counter-Earth (an earlier Counter-Earth had been created by the [[High Evolutionary]] and removed by the Beyonders). \n\nReunited with his family, Franklin moved into Pier Four, the FF’s new waterfront headquarters. Franklin got a pet,a dog-like creature named Puppy who seemed a younger, smaller twin to the Inhumans’ [[Lockjaw]], and a new caretaker, the dimensionally displaced Caledonia. Franklin also acquired a sister when the time-dancing  [[Richards, Valeria|Valeria von Doom]] (claimed daughter of Susan Richards) joined the family. Franklin’s time at Pier Four proved brief; when catastrophe loomed, Reed and Sue sent Franklin, Puppy, and Caledonia to Haven, a school located on the far side of the universe, where they were soon joined by Valeria. When Franklin dreamed of Valeria’s death at the hand of the cosmic force [[Abraxas]], he and Valeria retuned to Earth. When Abraxas did appear, Valeria and Franklin combined their powers to ressurect the only being capable of stopping Abraxas: Galactus. \n\nFranklin learned that Valeria was the sister he had sent elsewhere, and he exhausted his remaining powers to restore her to his mother’s womb as an infant. After Valeria’s birth, Franklin felt ignored and unloved, and his attempts to regain his parents attention inadvertently led to the creation of the mathematical menace [[Modulus]]. As he began to feel apart of the family again, he was transported to Hell by Dr. Doom; though quickly rescued, Franklin was severely traumatized by the incident, even believing he was still in Hell. Only his family’s love and the honesty of his uncle Ben made Franklin realize that no matter how bad things got, his family would always do their best for him. Franklin has since sought a more normal childhood, attending private academies, going on New Jersey camping trips with friends his own age, and even playing Little League baseball. While trying desperately to succeed in the latter, he tapped into his powers again, temporarily disrupting the space-time continuum. With his family’s guidance, Franklin has the potential to become one of the most powerful beings in existence.",

Jessica eventually moved to Los Angeles where she worked as a bounty hunter alongside Scotty McDowell before Nick Fury helped her secure private investigator credentials.

Following Charlotte's defeat at the hands of [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] (herself a self-styled Spider-Woman), Jessica once more regained her uncanny abilities accepting an offer from Hydra while working as a double agent for Nick Fury. After seventeen months of procedures, she emerged more powerful than ever, now capable of fully flying (rather than just gliding on air currents). After serving with Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Luke Cage as the Avengers formed in the aftermath of M-Day, Jessica left the team after the Superhuman Registration Act divided the heroes. She ultimately decided to ally herself with Captain America's anti-registration team, and was part of the unsanctioned Avengers.\n\nAfter the events of Civil War, the remnants of Captain America's rebellious Avengers formed the New Avengers, aided by Doctor Strange.",

May was unaware of her father's heroic past until her own latent powers revealed themselves at a crucial point in a ballgame. Walking home afterwards, she was menaced by the [[Green Goblin (MC2)|Green Goblin]] - Norman Osborn, Jr. - who hungered for revenge on Peter Parker for the long-past battle that killed Norman's grandfather and crippled Spider-Man. Instead, it was Spider-Girl who faced the new Green Goblin, and twin legacies were born anew.[[Image:Spidergirlinline.jpg|left]]\n\nPeter and Mary Jane Parker initially forbade May from adopting her new role, but they soon realized that their protests were in vain, and Peter chose to help teach his daughter the skills she would need to survive. As Spider-Girl, May encountered many new villains and allies in her war against crime. Most importantly, she convinced Norman Jr. to abandon his pointless feud, and they co-founded a loosely banded super-team of \"[[New Warriors (MC2)|New Warriors]].\"\n\nIn a battle with the super-villain [[Killerwatt (MC2)|Killerwatt]], who controlled electricity, Spider-Girl was severely shocked. This apparently caused her to lose her powers, until, in a battle with the new Spider-Man, she fell into a generator, where she was, again, shocked severely. Her powers returned, along with a few new powers.\n\nSpider-Girl was faced with other specters from her father's past, including the near-invincible [[Black Tarantula (MC2)|Black Tarantula]]. The Tarantula arrived from South America to select May Parker as the perfect young woman to continue his bloodline. Creating \"Team Spider\" to supposedly assist May in her war on evil, he began a twisted mind-game to win May's heart, all the while seeking to strengthen his grip on New York's criminal infrastructure.\n\nMay has also fought versions of classic Spider-Man villains. She once fought the [[Savage Six (MC2)|Savage Six]], and has also fought [[Aftershock (MC2)|Aftershock]] (Electro's daughter). She recently teamed up with Felicity Hardy, who has taken on the role of the [[Scarlet Spider (MC2)|Scarlet Spider]]. She also occasionally faces old villains from Spider-Man's past. She has faced [[Kaine]], [[Venom (MC2)|Venom]], [[Kingpin (Wilson Fisk)|the Kingpin]], [[Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley)|the Hobgoblin]], and [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)|Doctor Octopus]], to name a few.\n\nRecently, May experienced some of Kaine's power and they both saw a vision of her being stabbed to death in her red and blue costume. She started wearing her black costume to try to trick fate, but she was nevertheless stabbed by a Scrier in a battle. Near death, Normie gave her his [[Glossary:S#Symbiote|symbiote]] (as a farewell gift, the symbiote healed Normie's scars and tattoos) and the symbiote healed May. In order to save May from the Hobgoblin, the symbiote (who turned out to be a she) drove the Hobgoblin away, but in the process was killed by his sonic emitter. Hobgoblin later escaped.\n\nWhether facing old Spider-Man villains, newer versions of classic bad-guys, or completely new villains, Spider-Girl will always uphold her father's motto: With great power, there must always come great responsibility.",

When a burglar killed his Uncle Ben, Peter vowed to use those abilities to protect his fellow man, driven by his uncle's words: '''With great power comes great responsibility!'''\n\n=== The Boy, the Bite, and the Burglar ===\n[[image: Ditko-Parker-shadow.jpg|frame|border|left|middle|125px]]Orphaned as a baby when his parents were killed overseas in a plane crash as U.S. government spies, only child Peter Parker was raised by his elderly [[Parker, Ben (Uncle Ben)|Uncle Ben]] and [[Parker, May (Aunt May)|Aunt May]]. Academically gifted, Peter displayed an uncanny affinity for science that was nothing short of genius.  Socially, however, he was painfully shy and the target of much cruelty by his peers at [[Midtown High School]]. Attending a public science exhibit when Peter was 15-years old, he was bitten on the hand by a radioactive spider accidentally irradiated by a particle beam, empowering Peter with the arachnid's proportional strength and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. [[image: spiderbite-LWeeks.jpg|frame|right]]Most incredibly, he had gained a sixth sense that provided him with early warning of impending danger. Disguised, Peter tested his new-found abilities defeating professional wrestler [[Crusher Hogan]] in the ring, and earning some cash.  Using his scientific prowess, he constructed a pair of artificial web-shooters that attached to his wrists. With an agent, a costume, and a new name, Spider-Man became an overnight sensation on television. Unconcerned with the rest of the world, he vowed to use his powers only to take care of himself and his aunt and uncle. After his first TV special ended, he allowed a burglar that he could have easily restrained to run past him and escape.  A few days later, Peter returned home to find his beloved Uncle Ben had been shot and killed. When Spider-Man confronted the killer hiding in the old Acme Warehouse at the waterfront, he discovered to his horror that his uncle's murderer was the burglar he apathetically allowed to pass. Consumed with guilt, he became aware at last that with great power comes great responsibility, just as his beloved uncle had once said.\n\nTo help his Aunt May with finances, Peter took a freelance job at the Daily Bugle selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to publisher [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J. Jonah Jameson]]. Despite Spider-Man rescuing his son, astronaut John Jameson, from a malfunctioning space capsule, Jonah used his newspaper to publicly condemn Spider-Man as a menace. Unlike heroes like the [[Fantastic Four]] or the [[Avengers]], Spider-Man was mistrusted and feared by the public. At school, his popularity was no greater, as \"Puny Parker\" frequently clashed with bully [[Thompson, Flash|Flash Thompson]] and his followers. Flash's girlfriend, [[Osborn, Liz|Liz Allan]], often complicated matters, harboring a crush on \"Petey\" and making Flash jealous.\n\n=== A Gathering of Enemies ===\nSpider-Man soon found himself facing a rogue's gallery of powerful thieves, gangsters, and megalomaniacs including the [[Chameleon]], the [[Tinkerer]], the [[Vulture (Adrian Toomes)]], [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)]], the [[Sandman]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], and [[Electro]]. In Florida, he befriended Dr. Curtis Connors after administering an antidote to reverse his transformation into the terrible [[Lizard]]. Though he had many enemies, he also shared adventures with the [[Fantastic Four]] (including rival the Human Torch), the [[Avengers]], the [[X-Men]] and [[Daredevil]]. At the Daily Bugle, he discovered a friend and his first love, Jameson's secretary, [[Brant, Betty|Betty Brant]]. Even more villains clashed with Spider-Man including the [[Iron Patriot (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]], the Big Man and the Enforcers, [[Mysterio (Quentin Beck)]], and [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]]. Dating Betty became awkward after her brother, Bennett, was murdered in a clash between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. Betty at first held Spider-Man responsible. Though she later recanted, the thought of Spider-Man reminded her of losing her brother. At home, Aunt May suffered a heart attack, causing Spider-Man to abandon a fight with the Green Goblin. For a while after, the public viewed Spider-Man as a coward, before he made a comeback. May's fragile health and poor finances, however, remain a lingering concern. Frustrated by their defeats at the hand of Spider-Man, six of his top villains gathered forces under Doctor Octopus to form the [[Sinister Six]]. Through wits and determination, Spider-Man defeated the group one at a time. \n\nPeter Parker’s confidence gradually increased. At the same time, his relationship with Betty crumbled as handsome reporter Ned Leeds stole her heart. Jameson took his campaign against Spider-Man to a new level, sponsoring the creation of the deranged [[Venom (Mac Gargan)|Scorpion]], under Dr. Farley Stillwell. Though the Scorpion turned on Jameson, the publisher persisted with attacks against Spider-Man, and rented the first of a series of robotic Spider Slayers invented by Dr. Spencer Smythe. Spider-Man was able to use his technical know-how to defeat the Slayer. While Aunt May persisted with attempts to introduce Peter to [[Watson, Mary Jane|Mary Jane Watson]], the niece of neighbor Anna Watson, Spider-Man tackled organized crime led by the Crime Master and the Green Goblin. Tired of the Bugle's harassment, Peter tried selling pictures for the Daily Globe but gave up when the Globe's editor proved too nosy. \n\n=== Big Super-Hero on Campus ===\n[[image:Pete-Gwen-gang-JRSR.jpg|frame|left]]After capturing a new foe, the Molten Man, Peter Parker graduated high school and earned a science scholarship to Empire State University (ESU) for achieving the highest scholastic average in Midtown High's history. College brought a fresh start with new peers including the wealthy [[Osborn, Harry|Harry Osborn]], son of industrialist Norman Osborn, and beauty queen of Standard High, Gwen Stacy; Flash Thompson followed Peter to ESU on an athletic scholarship. Consumed with worry about his aunt's hospitalization, Peter was misunderstood as an unfriendly snob by Harry and Gwen. Because a previous transfusion of his radioactive blood to Aunt May was slowly killing her, Spider-Man enlisted aid from [[Lizard (Curtis Connors)|Dr. Connors]]. The antidote that had been called in to cure Aunt May was stolen, and Spider-Man fought like a madman to retain it. Before Spider-Man could deliver the antidote, ISO-36, he was trapped under rubble in a battle with the \"Master Planner” (revealed to be Doctor Octopus). Spider-Man courageously forced his way out to administer the elixir to Aunt May.\n\nWhile Aunt May convalesced, Peter relaxed and befriended Harry and Gwen. Soon after, the Green Goblin negated Spider-Man's spider-sense, and kidnapped him. There, the Goblin revealed himself to be Harry's father, Norman. The two battled, but Spider-Man triumphed knocking the Goblin into live wires and chemicals. Norman was left with partial amnesia, blocking his memories of being Goblin and of Spider-Man's identity.\n\nThe Avengers invited Spider-Man to join their ranks, but after facing the Hulk, he declined the offer, preferring the freedom of working alone. Meanwhile, Peter could no longer evade meeting Mary Jane. Assuming the worst, Peter was stunned to discover she was both gorgeous and vivacious.  Their first date involved riding into the city on Pete's new motorcycle take pictures of the Rhino. After another battle with the Lizard and new foe, the Shocker, Peter moved into Harry's apartment, rent free. Despite his new found independence, happiness eluded him. Worn out by Jameson's editorials, the public's fear of him, Aunt May's fragile health, slipping grades, and floundering love life, Peter decided to become Spider-Man no more. While Peter enjoyed time studying, and being with friends and family, crime escalated as the Kingpin's initiated his master plan to oversee the criminal underworld. After Peter rescued a watchman resembling Uncle Ben from two robbers, he renewed his vow to never let an innocent come to harm because he failed to act. Subsequently, Spider-Man battled the [[Kingpin]], Doctor Octopus (who became Aunt May's boarder), a new Vulture, a new Spider Slayer, and Mysterio.  He and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] went to Hollywood where they tackled Mysterio and the [[Wizard]].\n\n=== The Girl, the Goblin, and the Great Heartbreak ===\nThough Peter dated MJ on occasion, he soon fell for the more serious-minded Gwen, causing tension between Harry and himself. Peter met Gwen's father, retired police Captain [[Stacy, George|George Stacy]], who studied Spider-Man, and questioned Peter about his first-hand experience. The Kingpin brainwashed Capt. Stacy (using Norman Osborn's equipment) into stealing police records. After Peter published pictures exposing Stacy, the Kingpin kidnapped George and Gwen. Spider-Man and Osborn rescued the two, but the Kingpin escaped. The Kingpin next focused on stealing a legendary stone tablet but Spider-Man retrieved it, and left it with Capt. Stacy. The Shocker stole it back, and Dr. Connors was forced by Man Mountain Marko to translate it for an aged gangster, [[Silvermane]]. Connors revealed a formula for a youth potion. Silvermane drank the liquid, and became a young man again. Tragically, he could not stop the de-aging process, and shrank so small, he ultimately disappeared. Meanwhile, the stress on Dr. Connors triggered a transformation again. After a fierce melee across the city, with unwelcome help from the Human Torch, Spider-Man rescued Connors.\n\n[[image:Gwendeath01.jpg|frame|right]]Though Peter's frequent unexplained disappearances as Spider-Man have caused friction with Gwen, their love for each other gave Peter hope for a happy future together. As the bond between Peter and Gwen grew ever stronger, it was approvingly observed by Gwen's father, Police Captain George Stacy, who also supported the efforts of Spider-Man. But tragedy struck when Captain Stacy was crushed by a falling chimney, saving an innocent child during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. With his dying breath, Captain Stacy told Spider-Man, \"take care of Gwen, Peter\". Spider-Man had lost a great ally. \n\nGwen blamed Spider-Man for her father's death.  Peter's conscience, already tormented by the ever present need to lie to Gwen, became even more troubled.  Yet their love prevailed through life's challenges - including Harry's drug addiction, and Spider-Man's aborted attempt to remove his own powers, that instead resulted in him being transformed into a six armed freak. In the end, it was death which separated the two lovers.  The Green Goblin kidnapped Gwen, and dropped her off the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man tried, but failed to save her.  In the vicious battle which followed, Norman was accidentally impaled by his own Goblin Glider. His apparent death was secretly observed by his son, Harry, who swore his own revenge on Spider-Man. Harry soon succumbed to the Osborn Legacy, kidnapping those whom Peter loved most, only barely being stopped from finishing the work that Norman Osborn had started.\n\n=== A Clone is Born ===\nMeanwhile Peter and Gwen's college Professor, Miles Warren, had begun his own deadly schemes as the [[Jackal]]. Miles blamed Spider-Man for the death of Gwen, whom he had himself fallen in love with. The climax of the Jackal's plan was his creation of a [[Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly)|Spider-Man clone]], but at the conclusion of the final battle, both the Jackal and the clone were killed. With their departure, Peter's life returned to normality, as much as it ever could for a college student who was secretly a costumed super-hero.\n\nIn the meantime, Peter and Mary Jane realized that their relationship had become far more than just friendship. So much so that, shortly before his college graduation, Peter proposed to Mary Jane. But she had seen too much pain in her own family, and she turned him down. She left New York to pursue her modeling career in Florida, and Peter Parker moved on to post-graduate studies. It was a time for new challenges, and new friends.  But one thing would never change; the ever-present responsibility he faced as Spider-Man. \n\n=== Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places ===\nEntering his post-graduate studies, Peter's close college friends began to find their own lives. Liz Allan was dating (later to marry) a recovering Harry Osborn.  Flash Thompson was looking for a life after football and the army, with his girlfriend Sha Shan. Betty Brant had married Bugle reporter [[Hobgoblin (Ned Leeds)|Ned Leeds]]. Even Peter's Aunt May had found romance with [[Lubensky, Nathan|Nathan Lubensky]], fellow occupant of the convalescent home she had moved into. With his friends all in cozy couples, Mary Jane's departure was all the more unsettling. But it was not long before Peter began dating again. He enjoyed several dates with Cissy Ironwood. Also, departmental secretary Deborah Whitman was attracted to Peter, but failed to win his heart. Dawn Starr, undergraduate student, pretended to date Peter though actually wanting to sneak a look at an upcoming exam. Amy Powell tried to use Peter to make her fiancé Lance Bannon jealous.\n\n=== A Partner in Crimefighting ===\nThese women had one thing in common - Peter Parker. But when [[Black Cat|Felicia Hardy]], crossed Spider-Man's path, things were different. Felicia was beautiful, talented, and determined.  She was also an unrepentant burglar who had a romantic fascination with her web-slinging hero. Spider-Man persuaded Felicia to turn away from crime, and the two of them became lovers - and crime-fighting partners. Felicia urged Peter to spend more and more time in costume. The glamorous Black Cat could never bear to see her super-hero living the squalid life of post-grad student. Becoming Spider-Man was made easier since Aunt May had recovered enough to return home and open the Parker residence as a boarding home for retired people, aided by Nathan. Aided by the Black Cat, Spider-Man faced Doc Ock and the [[Owl]] - a battle which nearly cost Felicia her life.  Peter was brought crashing down to earth. He realized that without super-powers, Felicia was just like the others from his past, who had so often paid the price for Peter being Spider-Man. \n\n=== The Redhead Returns ===\nWhen Mary Jane returned from Florida she found Peter and the Black Cat in a shaky and tempestuous relationship. Felicia could not bear the thought of Peter not allowing her to accompany him into battle, and she embarked on a secret search for super-powers at any price. Tricked by the Kingpin, and twisted in her own deceit, the Black Cat and Spider-Man finally parted ways. In contrast, Mary Jane was determined not to let lies come between her and Peter Parker. She finally told Peter that she had known for some time about his secret identity. With Spider-Man's secret finally out in the open, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship found new depth.  \n\n=== Peter Makes a New Friend from Outer Space ===\n[[image:BlackCostume-CVess-WOS1.jpg|frame|left]]Certainly there always was plenty of action for Spider-Man in New York, especially with the appearance of the deadly [[Hobgoblin]], and Peter's troubles with his symbiotic black costume he obtained after being whisked away to the [[Secret Wars]], a battle on a far away world between the Earth's greatest heroes and villains orchestrated by the enigmatic [[Maker|Beyonder]]. His costume shredded, Spider-Man thought he obtained a new black and white costume (similar in design to the new [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]) from a costume making machine. After returning home to Earth, Peter discovered his costume was actually a living entity, feeding off his adrenalin as it possessed his body while he slept. Thanks to [[Mister Fantastic]], the costume was removed by sonic blasts, and captured. It escaped, still emotionally dependant on Spider-Man and reattached itself. Spider-Man forced it off by the loud noise atop the bell-tower of a church (where the alien costume would later attach itself to Eddie Brock forming [[Anti-venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]]).\n\n=== Wedding Bells for the Webhead ===\nAs Spider-Man, Peter faced the death of his good friend [[Dewolff, Jean|Police Captain Jean DeWolff]] at the hands of the [[Sin-Eater]]. He watched Flash Thompson be taken for a criminal, and Ned Leeds killed, both for their involvement with the Hobgoblin. But things were different now - he had Mary Jane by his side. Peter proposed for a second time, and was accepted. As newlyweds, Peter and Mary Jane shared happiness, but faced many perils also. Mary Jane was menaced by both Kraven the Hunter, and by Venom, both of whom knew Peter's identity. Mary Jane loved Peter, and had deep respect for his sense of responsibility. But she was unprepared for the loneliness, the fear for his life, and the nagging doubt that perhaps Peter needed Spider-Man far more than he needed her. During this time, Spider-Man gained the cosmic powers of [[Captain Universe]] making him virtually indestructible, able to fly, shoot cosmic energy blasts, and possess unimaginable strength. This temporary augmentation allowed Spider-Man to defend himself against a new assortment of foes (including [[Graviton]], [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], [[Titania (Mary MacPherran)|Titania]], and [[Dragon Man]]), as villains attempted to aid each other by targeting each others' enemies. At the opposite extreme, Spider-Man temporarily lost all of his powers under the trickery of the [[Chameleon]], but was aided by the Black Cat in restoring his abilities. Spider-Man, along with the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] briefly formed an unofficial ad-hoc Fantastic Four team, while the real Fantastic Four were captured by Skrulls. The group quickly disbanded.\n\nAmongst the daily battles with New York's villains, and the challenges of keeping his marriage alive, Peter soon faced the inexplicable return of his parents, [[Parker, Mary|Mary]] and [[Parker, Richard|Richard Parker]]. Long since believed dead, they claimed to have lost their memory of the intervening years. Aunt May was not ready to accept them, but Peter finally believed them to be what they claimed to be, even showing them his identity as Spider-Man. But Peter's heart had over-ridden his instincts. The pair were eventually revealed as robot agents of the Chameleon, part of a plan prompted by Harry Osborn, recently returned as the Green Goblin. Spider-Man was filled with anger at this deeply personal attack.  It seemed to him that those he loved were fated to die, while the evil in his life would always return to haunt him.  \n\n=== I Am the Spider ===\nA darkness began to fill Spider-Man's heart, like never before. Still brooding over the Chameleon's invasion of his life, and Harry's death after a twisted attack on both the Osborn and Parker families, Peter was then faced with Aunt May's serious heart attack. May hospitalized, and not expected to recover. Peter's frustration at life's injustices boiled over into violence. Encountering the recently reformed and powerless Scorpion, Spider-Man cruelly beat his former foe close to death - ignoring his victim's pleas for mercy. Calling himself \"the Spider\", it seemed that Peter was even beyond Mary Jane's powers to heal him.  In the end, his salvation came at the hands of [[Judas Traveller]], a psychologist with most unusual methods. Peter's recovery from his dark madness coincided with the return of a figure from Peter's distant past - his clone, created by the Jackal. The clone had survived, and had wandered the U.S. using the adopted name \"Ben Reilly\". Learning that Aunt May was very ill, the clone returned to New York, just in time to see her pass away. He adopted a costumed identity as the \"Scarlet Spider\", and portrayed himself as Peter's long-lost cousin. Peter and Ben became friends, even almost brothers. The Jackal himself had also survived. Deceived at the hands of Norman Osborn, the Jackal declared that in fact Ben was the original, and Peter the clone. Though Peter took the revelation badly, Ben subsequently took over the role of Spider-Man, leaving Peter and pregnant Mary Jane free to enjoy a \"normal\" life. Peter returned to his scientific career, though hampered by having never completed his doctorate. He and MJ also tried moving to Portland, until they realized that New York was where they truly belonged. But all too soon, their new world was shattered when Norman Osborn burst back into their lives. He also had survived his apparent death, and was the mastermind behind all of the Jackal's schemes. Norman killed Ben, revealing him to be the clone after all. But Norman's schemes went even deeper and deadlier than ever - he apparently caused Mary Jane to miscarry the baby and held Peter's Aunt May hostage. The woman believed to have been Aunt May that had died was a genetically modified actress, part of a subtle plot which was never carried to fruition. \n\n=== A New Chapter ===\nReunited at last, Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May moved into a luxurious apartment. With the Green Goblin defeated in battle, driven more deeply insane by a mystical ceremony, Peter promise Mary Jane that he would give up being Spider-Man and concentrate on their family. He took a job at Tri Corp Research while Mary Jane returned to modeling. But after various emergencies and the appearance of a new Spider-Man (actually [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]]), Peter could not seem to keep his word.\n\nWhile Mary Jane was being increasingly threatened by an anonymous stalker, Peter was secretly breaking his promise and returning to web-slinging. Mary Jane, preoccupied with modeling, was distraught feeling a space grow between her and Peter. After catching Peter still active as Spider-Man, MJ vanished when a plane she had boarded exploded. Peter was devastated. Aunt May returned to her home in Forest Hills, while Peter returned to his bachelor lifestyle moving in with Randy Robertson. He socialized with Randy, [[Grant, Glory|Glory Grant]] (now a couple), and Gwen's cousin [[Stacy, Jill| Jill Stacy]] while his attractive neighbor, Caryn intrigued him. But with Peter still emotionally adrift, Norman picked the perfect time to drug Peter and incite him to becoming his heir. But even lost and confused as he was, Peter proved that his could resist Osborn's brainwashing attempt. Meanwhile, Mary Jane was not dead, but had been kidnapped by her stalker. Spider-Man managed to rescue Mary Jane, only to discover that she needed time away from him. Mary Jane left for the West Coast, leaving Peter to struggle with a loss almost as traumatic as her apparent death. While Peter turned to his Aunt May for support, May discovered Peter's greatest secret, visiting unannounced, and finding him asleep in costume after his grueling victory against [[Morlun]]. After coming to terms with the truth, May quickly became Spider-Man's strongest supporter, and the two became closer than ever.  At May's suggestion, Peter returned to Midtown High, now more rundown that Peter remembered it, to teach science part-time. With renewed hopes, Peter and Mary Jane agreed to try once to make things work between them. After their time apart, Peter earnestly assured Mary Jane that he truly needs her in his life.\n\n=== A Mystical Connection? ===\nThe mysterious [[Ezekiel]], who shared similar spider-like abilities, made Peter question the source of his powers, implying a mystical reason the spider chose to bite him. Ezekiel had stolen his powers through an arcane ceremony and needed to sacrifice Spider-Man to keep them. When his ritual joined their minds, however, Ezekiel realized Spider-Man was the worthy hero and sacrificed himself. \n\n=== A Past Indiscretion ===\n[[image: Spidey banner.jpg|frame|right|200px]]Back home, Spider-Man fought the two adult children of his ex-love, Gwen Stacy. Years before, Gwen had an affair with Norman Osborn, subsequently became pregnant and rapidly gave birth to twins, [[Stacy, Gabriel|Gabriel]] and [[Stacy, Sarah|Sarah]]. After his own apparent 'death,' Osborn raised the pair, who were aging rapidly due to their genetic inheritance of the Goblin formula. Osborn told them that Peter was their father and had killed their mother but Spider-Man eventually made them face the truth. \n\n\nOsborn also revealed Spider-Man's identity to the [[Venom (Mac Gargan)|Scorpion]], and had him kidnap Aunt May. Osborn had been publicly revealed as the Green Goblin and jailed after murdering journalist Terri Kidder. He knew big businesses had been conspiring for decades to create super-villains and, as a potential whistle-blower, was an easy target in prison. Osborn wanted Peter to break him out in return for May's freedom, but when Peter did, a battle erupted with the [[Sinister Twelve]], including Gargan himself - now the new Venom after bonding with the alien symbiote. Spider-Man, with the help of other super-heroes, was able to defeat the Sinister Twelve and save his Aunt May. Around this time, Spider-Man met the [[Queen]] who had powers allowing her to control the world's insects, eventually causing Spider-Man to mutate into a giant spider. She planned to detonate a bomb that would kill everyone except those with the \"insect\" gene but Peter returned to his human form and stopped her, augmented with enhanced powers including silk glands within his forearms. \n\n=== Major League ===\nAfter a breakout at the [[Raft|Raft Security Prison]], Spider-Man joined the Avengers (newly formed in the aftermath of the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s attack on her own team). An old classmate of Peter's named [[Weiderman, Charlie|Charlie Weiderman]] went on an insane rampage after his experiments covered him in [[Vibranium]], and burned down the Parker's home in Forest Hills. Peter moved into Tony Stark's tower with Aunt May and Mary Jane. For this and various other reasons, Spider-Man's secret identity was shared with many of the world's heroes including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, providing him with an venue to communicate among his peers.\n\n[[image:Ironcostumespideyinline.jpg|frame|left|200px]] \n\n=== The Other ===\nMorlun returned again, viciously beating Spider-Man, removing an eye, and hospitalizing him. Mary Jane tried to stop Morlun from finishing off her husband. But when Morlun threatened to kill her, Spider-Man gave the last of his energy to protect her. With stingers that burst from his wrists, Spider-Man slayed Morlun. Spider-Man then apparently died; however, a new Peter Parker emerged from the old corpse, now more fully embracing his \"other\" self - his spider personae. Retaining his stingers, he discovered other new abilities including night vision, greater control of his skin adhesive properties, and enhanced sensory perceptions, such as being able to sense the vibrations traveling through his webline. [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Tony Stark]] looking at Peter as his protégé, gave Spider-Man a new technologically advanced costume with a red and gold color scheme as a gift. \n\n=== Choosing Sides, Unmasking, and Switching Teams ===\nIn the aftermath of a tragedy in Stamford, Connecticut, in which a band of televised heroes were unable to prevent the villain [[Nitro]] from killing an entire elementary school full of children and parts of the surrounding community, the U.S. government propelled forward the Superhuman Registration Act requiring the superhero community to register themselves as living weapons of mass destruction, and reveal their identities to the government. The act was supported by Tony Stark, who became the leader of the Pro-Registration side. The superheroic community was split between registering or refusing and becoming an outlaw. Leading the opposition to the act was [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], in defense of heroes' right to privacy. To support Iron Man, and perhaps obtain the ever-elusive respect from the public by compliance with the Act, Spider-Man made the difficult decision (with support from May and Mary Jane) to reveal his identity to the world during a press conference. As Spider-Man now faces the danger of public exposure to his family and loved ones, and the prospect of having to capture his renegade friends in what has become an all-out [[Civil War]] in the superpowered community, Peter regretted his decision. After witnessing a prison in the Negative Zone for super humans who refused to register, Parker fled Avengers Tower with his family, clashing with Iron Man during his exit. He aided Captain America and the forces opposing registration, culminating in a major battle during the jailbreak of the heroes imprisoned in the Negative Zone, Captain America's surrender, and the end of the Civil War. Spider-Man has remained a member of the unsanctioned Avengers team in the aftermath. Since Spider-Man's identity is now public knowledge, the Kingpin arranged a sniper to slay the Parker family. Though Mary Jane was spared, Parker was unable to prevent his aunt from getting shot. May was left in a coma on the verge of death. The anguish of yet another loved one injured because of his life as Spider-Man embittered the hero. He resumed wearing his black cloth costume, reflective of the dark times while his Aunt May was precariously close to death. Spider-Man confronted the Kingpin in Ryker's Island prison, and, while unmasked, beat him within an inch of his life, vowing to come back and kill him if Aunt May died.\n\n=== A Brand New Day and Hitting the Big Time ===\nWith time running out, Peter tried several avenues, from the technological to the mystical, to save May's life. At a dead-end, [[Mephisto]] appeared to Peter and Mary Jane offering to prevent May’s death, but at the cost of their holy bond of matrimony. After spending one more day together, Mary Jane selflessly took the initiative and agreed to the bargain, knowing Peter would never forgive himself if he rejected a chance to save May. She had faith that their love would be strong enough to reunite them. As a result, one event was removed from the lives of Peter and Mary Jane - they were never married, and Aunt May survived the shooting. Realizing how dangerous it was to reveal his secret identity, Peter, through the combined efforts of Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, and Reed Richards, had the world not only forget he was Spider-Man, but be mystically confused if ever considering they were the same person. Mary Jane was exempted from forgetting, but later broke up with him, unable to cope with the strain of being Spider-Man's girlfriend.\n\nSingle and jobless, Peter was reunited with his old friend Harry Osborn - whose death had been part of an elaborate hoax by his father. Spider-Man also returned to using web-shooters, rather than his own self-generated organic webbing, for reasons that have not yet been revealed. Over time, Peter unmasked again to a select group of heroes including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Through connections with Marla Jameson, Peter acquired a dreat job at Horizon Labs, where his skills as a brilliant scientist and inventor have earned him a steady paycheck. Marla's death, killed by Spider-Slayer Alistaire Smythe, inspired Spider-Man to promise that nobody else dies on his watch. The Jackal (or possibly a clone), partnered with the Queen and turned New York City into \"Spider-Island\" wherein bedbugs gave many the powers of Spider-Man. Peter and his colleagues at Horizon helped stop the plague. Peter's girlfriend at the time, forensic detective Carlie Cooper, temporarily gained powers in the event. Afterwards, she discovered Peter's secret identity and broke up with him. Despite their differences, she remains an ally.\n\nOne of Parker's experiments at Horizon accidentally bestowed super powers into an irresponsible teen (Andrew Maguire). As Alpha, Maguire became Spider-Man's arrogant sidekick, with little regard for Spider-Man's concern for his well being. \n\n<HR>\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Spider-Man\" at the [[Spider-Man (disambiguation)|Disambiguation Page]].",

        "bio" : "Gwen Stacy was [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Peter Parker]]'s first true love. Next to the death of his [[Parker, Ben (Uncle Ben)|Uncle Ben]], no death has weighed as heavily upon Spider-Man's shoulders as her passing.\n\nGwen came to Empire State University from Standard High School, where she had been the resident \"beauty queen\". Arriving at ESU, she and fellow science major [[Green Goblin (Harry Osborn)|Harry Osborn]] befriended jock [[Thompson, Flash|Flash Thompson]]. Flash attempted to introduce Harry and Gwen to Peter, his high school classmate, during their first chemistry lab. When a preoccupied Peter unintentionally ignored Flash and his new friends, popular Gwen and wealthy Harry did not take kindly to the perceived snub. Spitefully, Harry sabotaged Peter's lab experiment - setting the stage for a rocky start to their eventual friendship.\n\n[[image:Gwen-miniheadshot.jpg|thumb|left]]Peter had too much on his plate to worry about building friendships at school. His aunt, [[Parker, May (Aunt May)|May Parker]], was recovering from radiation poisoning; he was still licking his wounds from his recent battles as Spider-Man against [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]], the [[Molten Man]], the [[Looter]], [[Stromm, Mendel|Mendel Stromm]], and the [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]]; and he had just broken up with girlfriend [[Brant, Betty|Betty Brant]].\n\nOver time, Peter reconciled with Gwen, Harry, and Flash - transcending his reputation as a standoffish scholarship student. Despite her friends' misgivings about the bookish Peter, Gwen's intuition to her there was more to him than met the eye.\n\nGwen's emotional breakthrough occurred after Peter turned up at ESU one day on his new motorcycle - a move that greatly surprised her and the rest of the gang. Having just defeated the Green Goblin, Peter was riding high - and for once, free of his many problems. Re-examining her previously held opinion, Gwen found in her heart a true romantic attraction - one Peter clearly returned.\n\nTheir budding relationship was immediately tested by the arrival of [[Watson-Parker, Mary Jane|Mary Jane Watson]] - the spunky glamorous niece of Aunt May's friend, Anna Watson. An aspiring model, Mary Jane quickly fell in with Peter's crowd and showed an interest in the young man she had been watching for some time - causing tension between her and Gwen. But Mary Jane was far too wild and free to settle her heart on any one man, and Gwen knew right away Peter was the one for her. The pair soon surrendered to their irresistible love.\n\n[[image:DancinGwen.jpg|thumb|left]]But because of Peter's hidden life as Spider-Man, it was clear their love affair would never run smoothly. Missed dates, unexplained absences, secrets he could never tell - all these things conspired to cast his relationship with Gwen as a roller coaster of confusion, tears, and reconciliation. But Gwen's wise father, retired police captain George Stacy, warmly approved of Peter and did what he could to keep the two young lovers together.\n\nThe [[Kingpin]] of crime brainwashed Capt. Stacy into stealing police records. After Peter published pictures exposing Stacy, the Kingpin kidnapped George and Gwen. Spider-Man and Norman Osborn (then an amnesiac to his escapades as the Green Goblin) rescued the two, though the Kingpin escaped. Subsequently, Gwen visited Norman to thank him for saving her and her father's lives. She found Norman despondent, yet powerfully alluring and charismatic. Feeling both sympathetic and attracted to Osborn, a spontaneous affair between the two ensued, leaving Gwen pregnant with twins. \n\nTragically, Gwen's father was killed protecting an innocent child during a battle between Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)|Doctor Octopus]]. In his dying breath, George revealed that he knew who Spider-Man was beneath the mask, asking him to watch over Gwen. A bereaved Gwen held the hero responsible for her father's death. Peter withdrew while Gwen raged against his alter-ego. With her relationship with Peter in turbulence, and lacking parents at home, Gwen accepted the invitation of her Uncle Arthur and Aunt Nancy to live with them in London. Unable to reconcile how to convince Gwen to stay knowing she would ultimately find out he was secretly the person she hated, Peter let Gwen leave, while she silently hoped Peter would propose marriage to her. However, before long, Peter was unable to bear being without her, and flew to London on assignment with the [[Daily Bugle (Building)|Daily Bugle]], to convince Gwen to return. But an appearance of Spider-Man made the local papers, and Peter returned home fearing an obvious connection would be made. Despite his failed attempt to see Gwen, his heroic deeds convinced Arthur that Spider-Man couldn't be responsible for his brother's death. Listening to her uncle, and realizing she may have expected too much of Peter, Gwen returned home again, certain she could salvage her relationship. She was met by Peter's welcoming arms. During her absence, Norman became the Green Goblin again, Harry turned to L.S.D. while Mary Jane, his supposed girlfriend, blatantly flirted with Peter. \n\n[[image:GwenStacy01.jpg|220px|thumb|left]]Peter hinted at marriage to Gwen despite the constant trouble of leading a double-life - including secretly growing four extra arms for a time. Their love proved true and strong. Peter took Gwen with him on an expedition and photo shoot of the Savage Land in Antarctica, where Gwen acted as a model. The pair had an exciting adventure, encountering the colossal beast, [[Gog]], which took Gwen back to its master, Kraven the Hunter, to be his queen. Kraven and Gog were defeated by Spider-Man and [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]].\n\nOnce Norman Osborn again recovered his memory of Peter's secret identity, he burned with a desire for revenge against Spider-Man. Gwen, now aware of her pregnancy, fled to Europe where she secretly carried the twins to full term after only a seven month gestation, giving birth to [[Gray Goblin (Gabriel Stacy)|Gabriel]] and Sarah. Osborn arranged to provide for the twins in Paris while Gwen returned home and reunited with Peter. Gwen argued with Norman that she should raise the children, assuming that Peter's love would enable him to overlook her infidelity and they would marry. Gwen confided only in Mary Jane, who had overheard the argument and promised to keep her secret. Osborn planned to raise the children to be heirs to the Goblin legacy. Hitting the wall-crawler where it would hurt most, and to rid himself of a young nuisance, the Goblin kidnapped Gwen and carried her to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man arrived and was horrified to find the woman he loved in the hands of his nemesis. Spider-Man blazed into battle, but his ferocity was not enough to prevent the Goblin from pushing Gwen off the bridge. In his last desperate act to save his beloved, Spider-Man fired a slender web-line that caught Gwen by her ankle, stopping her fall before she hit the water. Her neck snapped. Raising her up, Spider-Man discovered she was already dead. The Goblin taunted him, saying that Gwen had been killed by the shock of the fall before he caught her.\n\n[[image:Death-of-Gwen-framed.jpg|right|200px|thumb]]\nEven though after Gwen's murder, Spider-Man's subsequent confrontation with the Green Goblin ended in Norman's apparent death at the hands of his own remote-controlled Goblin Glider, Peter's anguish did not die so readily. Several years have passes since her death yet Peter is still tormented by nightmares, and has agonized over how he might have saved Gwen's life if he had done something differently. Peter's love for Gwen lives on in his memory, and deep within his heart, even though his love for Mary Jane has long since become the guiding force in his life. Peter recently used money he was paid to protect a corrupt mob boss named Forelli from [[Digger (The Vegas Thirteen)|Digger]], a monstrous undead gamma-spawned creature, to establish a memorial library in Gwen Stacy's name. When the Scarlet Witch's powers transformed the entire world into an alternate reality set under the rule of [[Magneto (House of M)|Magneto]] (the [[House of M]]), Peter and Gwen were married and had a child, Richard. That reality terminated, and life was returned back to the current reality ([[Marvel Universe|Earth 616]]) with the majority of the world unaware of what had transpired.\n\nA genetically stable clone of Gwen, engineered by her college professor, Dr. Miles Warren (the [[Jackal]]), later appeared, but opted to have nothing to do with Peter Parker's life. Married to a clone of Miles Warren, the clone of Gwen (named Gwen Miles) attempted to live a peaceful life in suburban New Jersey until her husband was killed in a car accident after recklessly fleeing from Peter's clone, [[Reilly, Ben|Ben Reilly]]. The Jackal, now a genetically mutated creature, had resurfaced, and created several other clones of Gwen, but they lacked Gwen Miles stability, decomposing after a short time. During a conflict upon the Daily Bugle's roof, Gwen had an opportunity to kill the Jackal, but she lacked the resolve. The Jackal and [[Spidercide]] both fell from the rooftop and were apparently killed. Gwen Miles slipped away; her current whereabouts are unknown.",
